# ScreenFlow
The vision for this app is to make a new worship presenter software,
mostly tailored to my needs, and actually functional and enjoyable to use.

## Architecture
So this is gonna be built upon the amazing electron framework.

## Some proposed features
- multiple displays, addressable individually, that allow for continuous or mirrored backgrounds.
- the standard stuff, text, pictures, pdf, video, audio. HTML5 should provide all of that.
- Maybe a Notion-like text/block markup style for services.
